## Ideas for the people who like beautiful code
- Find a way to tread PROTOCOLS as Rust traits. Since PROTOCOLS seem to only be made of function
  pointers
- Since all the Efi fields are pointers(except for the HDR table), we could replace them with
  function getters
- Write function to get system table easily without dereferencing it every time(maybe)
